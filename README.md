# HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Configured a Graphic User Interface that takes input about a patient’s personal info., their health issue and medications prescribed and store it in a SQL database at the back￿end which can later be used for printing prescription and search patient’s past medical history.

Software and modules used in this project are `Python tkinter` for **frontend GUI Design**, `Python MySQL.connector` for **connnecting python code with MySQL server**  and `MySQL server` for **storing data in the database at backend**.
